## How To Use

**Step 1:** Add app to your team from Ecosystem if it is not there

**Step 2:** Please, firstly use [`Diff Merge Project Meta`](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/apps/diff-merge-project-meta) app to merge project metas: classes and tags. As a result empty project with merged classes and tags will be created. This project should be used as a result project for current application. 

**Step 2:** Run app from the `Apps` page of current team. Choose two projects to compare and merge
